Hello, World From MYOS

This is my own project to making own OS ( Operating System ) from scratch

I`m student and I want to know everything about OS...

Package Depensitory:
    - i386-elf-gcc
    - make
    - qemu

To build and Run this project:
    - make ( For Build )
    - make run ( For Runing virtual emulator )

I hope this project can improve my programming skill and learning more about OS.
